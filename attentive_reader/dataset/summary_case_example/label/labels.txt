Description:
Hi Tech support,
I'm Chang Shin from PDF Solutions.
We have an Ethernet Switch (IKS-G6524A) with 4 SFP ports.
I need to use the SFP port with Xilinx 1000Base(X) and I have a question.
When I connect a loop back SFP module (I think electrical loop back), the LED on the port lights up to show the network activity.
However, when I plugged the SFP modules into two ports and connect them with fiber optics, the LED doesn't light up at all. On the other hand, when I plug the regular network cable into two regular network port, the LED lights up.
So I'm not sure what is the current problem.
I'd appreciate your suggestions ASAP.
Thanks,
Chang
